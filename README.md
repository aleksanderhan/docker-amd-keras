# docker-amd-keras
Dockerfile for keras leveraging the power of AMD gpus with plaidml

This should work, but it's an old version of plaidml and keras. You'll have to play with the versions if you want it to work with newer versions

If you want to use tensorflow 2.x you'll have to make the AMD drivers work with a 64-bit environment
